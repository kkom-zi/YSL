        <h3>KERING GROUP MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2019</h3>
        <p>THIS STATEMENT IS MADE PURSUANT TO SECTION 54 OF THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015 AND CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 
          2010 (SB 657). IT SETS OUT THE STEPS WHICH THE KERING GROUP AND THE COMPANIES IN THAT GROUP HAVE TAKEN DURING THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2019 
          TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT MODERN SLAVERY, INCLUDING FORCED LABOUR, HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOUR FROM 
          TAKING PLACE IN OUR SUPPLY CHAINS OR IN ANY PART OF OUR BUSINESS.</p>
        <p>IN THIS STATEMENT, THE TERM “KERING GROUP” REFERS TO KERING S.A., A FRENCH CORPORATION (“SOCIÉTÉ ANONYME”) REGISTERED WITH THE PARIS 
          TRADE.</p>
        <p>THIS REPORT COVERS THE FOLLOWING KERING GROUP BRANDS: GUCCI, SAINT LAURENT, BOTTEGA VENETA, BALENCIAGA, ALEXANDER MCQUEEN, 
          BRIONI, BOUCHERON, POMELLATO, DODO, QEELIN, ULYSSE NARDIN, GIRARD-PERREGAUX, AND KERING EYEWEAR, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT SOME OF 
          THE GROUP’S BRANDS MAY ALSO ISSUE THEIR OWN MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENTS.</p>
        <p>OUR AMBITION IS TO BE THE WORLD’S MOST INFLUENTIAL LUXURY GROUP IN TERMS OF CREATIVITY, SUSTAINABILITY AND LONG-TERM ECONOMIC 
          PERFORMANCE.</p>
        <p>AS SUCH, WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE LABOUR STANDARDS OF THOSE WHO WORK IN OUR SUPPLY CHAINS AND BUSINESSES. THIS 
          INCLUDES TAKING STEPS TO BOTH IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE RISKS OF MODERN SLAVERY.</p>
        <p>KERING TAKES A CROSS-FUNCTIONAL APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE OVER HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGES INCLUDING MODERN SLAVERY, INTEGRATED 
          INTO ITS OVERALL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOVERNANCE. SPECIFICALLY, HUMAN RIGHTS GOVERNANCE SPANS VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS, AMONG 
          WHICH THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT AND ITS DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND TALENT UNIT, THE SUPPLY CHAIN AUDIT DEPARTMENT, THE 
          COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT AND THE SECURITY DEPARTMENT. IT ALSO FALLS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUSTAINABILITY DEPARTMENT.</p>
        <p>THIS STATEMENT WAS VALIDATED BY THE BOARD ON JUNE 16TH, THE BOARD REPRESENTING THE GROUP AND THE ENTITIES IT CONTROLS.</p>

            <p>OUR HOUSES FOCUS ON THEIR CORE EXPERTISE AS THEY BENEFIT 
              FROM THE GROUP’S INTEGRATED MODEL AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS: 
              THE GROUP POOLS RESOURCES AND STREAMLINES CERTAIN KEY 
              FUNCTIONS FOR THE HOUSES SUCH AS LOGISTICS - BOTH INTEGRATED 
              AND OUTSOURCED, NON-PRODUCTION PURCHASING, LEGAL AFFAIRS,

              THE SUPPLIERS IN THE CENTRALLY MANAGED DATABASE IN 2019. THE SUPPLIER BASE MANAGED BY KERING’S CENTRAL TEAM FOR ITS HOUSES HAS THE 
              FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS :</p>
            <ol>
              <li>1. IN LINE WITH 2017 AND 2018, 2019 SAW A SHARP RISE IN THE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS MANAGED, WITH THE INCLUSION OF ALL PRODUCTION SUPPLIERS 
                AND STRONG GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIERS. THE JEWELLERY AND WATCHES HOUSES ARE GRADUALLY JOINING THE 
                SYSTEM, AS ARE KERING EYEWEAR’S SUPPLIERS, WHICH IT BEGAN ADDING IN OCTOBER 2019;</li>
              <li>2. TO DATE, IT COVERS 4,243 SUPPLIERS WITH THE FOLLOWING BREAKDOWN :
                <ol>
                  <li>1. 21.5% DIRECT SUPPLIERS (A SUPPLIER IS DEEMED DIRECT WHEN IT HAS A DIRECT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HOUSES RATHER THAN WORKING 
                    VIA A SUBCONTRACTOR),</li>
                  <li>2. 16.7% CONTRACTORS (DIRECT SUPPLIERS WORKING FOR ONE OR MORE HOUSES AND WHICH SUBCONTRACT PART OF THEIR PRODUCTION),</li>
                  <li>3. 61.8% SUBCONTRACTORS (WORKING FOR CONTRACTORS AND HAVING NO DIRECT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HOUSES). SUBCONTRACTING 
                    WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS NOT PERMITTED.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>AMONG ITS SUPPLIERS, KERING ALSO SINGLES OUT RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIERS. THOSE IDENTIFIED AS KEY TO THE GROUP REPRESENT ROUGHLY 20% OF 
              ALL SUCH SUPPLIERS, CORRESPONDING TO APPROXIMATELY 80% OF PURCHASES.</p>

        <strong>2 - HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENT OF PRACTICES</strong>
        <p>IN 2017 KERING ANALYSED ITS PRACTICES BY COMPARING THEM TO THE UNITED NATIONS GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS 
          ASSESSMENT ENABLED KERING TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC POINTS FOR PROGRESS IN AREAS INCLUDING PUBLIC COMMITMENT AND POLICY, SCOPE OF 
          INTERNAL CONTROL PROCEDURES, GRIEVANCE AND REMEDIATION MECHANISMS, AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS. FOLLOWING ON FROM THIS 
          ANALYSIS, KERING TOOK STEPS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF FRENCH 'DEVOIR DE VIGILANCE’ LEGISLATION, TO IDENTIFY RISKS AND 
          PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS, INCLUDING ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS.</p>
        <p>KERING ALSO CARRIED OUT A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE RISKS THAT THE GROUP MAY FACE, INCLUDING NON-FINANCIAL RISKS. AS A RESULT OF THIS 
          ANALYSIS, NON-COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OR THE GROUP’S STANDARDS IN THE AREA OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
          FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.</p>
        <p>IN 2020, KERING WILL BE CARRYING OUT A GROUP-WIDE HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENT STUDY.</p>
        <strong>3 - OUR STANDARDS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND RELEVANT ACTIONS ON MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN RIGHTS</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>A - OUR STANDARDS</b>
            <p>WE MANAGE RISKS AND IMPACTS RELATED TO MODERN SLAVERY AS PART OF OUR EXISTING PROGRAMME ON LABOUR RIGHTS, ETHICAL TRADE AND 
              HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH FALLS MORE BROADLY WITHIN OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY.</p>
            <p>KERING HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DEVELOPED ITS SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. IN 2017 WE PUBLISHED OUR 2025 SUSTAINABILITY 
              STRATEGY WHICH IS BASED ON THREE PILLARS - ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND INNOVATION - AND WHICH SETS AMBITIOUS TARGETS FOR ALL OF THE 
              HOUSES WHICH ARE PART OF THE GROUP.</p>
            <p>OUR SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED FOR ALL THE LUXURY HOUSES IN 2015 SPAN THE THREE FIELDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, LABOUR RIGHTS, AND 
              HEALTH AND SAFETY AMONG WHICH ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOUR, FORCED LABOUR, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN ALL ITS FORMS. THEY ARE 
              APPLICABLE ACROSS ALL HOUSES.</p>
            <p>WE PUBLISHED IN 2018 OUR KERING STANDARDS FOR SOURCING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. THE KEY FACTORS COVERED BY THE KERING 
              STANDARDS INCLUDE WORKING CONDITIONS, HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS IN PRODUCTION AND EXTRACTION PROCESSES FOR 
              OUR MAIN RAW MATERIALS. THEY INCLUDE OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WORKING IN OUR SUPPLY CHAINS ARE FREE FROM MODERN 
              SLAVERY.</p>
            <p>KERING’S APPROACH TO RESPONSIBILITY WITH REGARD TO STAKEHOLDERS IS SHAPED BY THE PRINCIPLES SET OUT IN ITS CODE OF ETHICS. SINCE 2013, 
              THE KERING GROUP’S CODE OF ETHICS HAS INCLUDED THE GROUP SUPPLIERS’ CHARTER. FOR ANY CONTRACTOR OF KERING OR ONE OF ITS HOUSES, 
              COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUPPLIERS’ CHARTER IS A PRECONDITION OF THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. THE SUPPLIERS’ CHARTER SPECIFIES KERING’S 
              EXPECTATIONS FOR ITS SUPPLIERS TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS WITHIN THEIR PRODUCTION UNITS AND AMONG THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS, AND TO 
              ADVISE KERING AND/OR ITS HOUSES OF ANY SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES IN APPLYING THE CHARTER. KERING AND ITS HOUSES REQUIRE THEIR SUPPLIERS TO 
              COMMIT TO FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AMONG WHICH: TO NOT USE CHILD LABOUR; TO PROSCRIBE THE USE OF SLAVERY OR FORCED OR 
              COMPULSORY LABOUR. THE SUPPLIERS’ CHARTER, AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CODE OF ETHICS, WAS REVISED IN 2018 AND THE CODE OF ETHICS 
              WAS REISSUED TO ALL EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE IN 2019. THE CODE OF ETHICS AND THE SUPPLIERS’ CHARTER HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED INTO THE 14 
              MOST WIDELY SPOKEN LANGUAGES WITHIN THE GROUP.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>B - OUR RISK MANAGEMENT</b>
            <p>NO CONTROL SYSTEM, REGARDLESS OF HOW MATURE AND TESTED IT IS, CAN GUARANTEE THE ABSENCE OF RISK, WHETHER THIS RELATES TO 
              MODERN SLAVERY OR OTHER LABOUR OR HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT IS BASED ON A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS, 
              TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FEEDBACKS AND GOOD PRACTICES.</p>
            <p>KERING GROUP AND ITS HOUSES SEEK TO WORK WITH SUPPLIERS TO DEVELOP THE MOST EFFICIENT COLLABORATIVE AND CONTROL SYSTEMS IN 
              ORDER TO KEEP RISK TO A MINIMUM AND IMPLEMENT ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION IN CASES WHERE NON-COMPLIANCE IS IDENTIFIED. TO MEET THESE 
              CHALLENGES, IN 2016 KERING HAS ESTABLISHED A DEDICATED CENTRAL BODY WITHIN THE GROUP TO CONTROL THE COMPLIANCE OF GROUP 
              SUPPLIERS. THE PROCESS, KNOWN AS THE HERCULES SYSTEM, IS BASED ON SIX KEY PILLARS:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>1. SUSTAINABILITY: THE SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES INCLUDE MANDATORY EXPECTATIONS, DUE TO REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY INTERNATIONAL AND 
              NATIONAL LAWS, AS WELL AS KERING’S ADDITIONAL EXPECTATIONS. THEY ARE EMBEDDED IN ILO AND UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS, UNITED 
              NATIONS GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, ETC. SUPPLIERS ARE REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY THE PRINCIPLES AND SUPPLIER 
              COMPLIANCE IS EVALUATED ON THIS BASIS. EACH SUPPLIER IS IN TURN TASKED WITH PASSING ON THESE PRINCIPLES TO ITS OWN SUBCONTRACTOR 
              NETWORK, IF IT HAS ONE. ALONG WITH THE CODE OF ETHICS, INCLUDING THE SUPPLIER’S CHARTER, THE PRINCIPLES ARE EMBODIED IN THE CONTRACT 
              TEMPLATE. THEY ARE SYSTEMATICALLY ISSUED TO SUPPLIERS AND BOTH FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH 
              KERING;</li>
            <li>2. CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT: KERING HAS CENTRALIZED OVERSIGHT THROUGH A TEAM OF 24 PEOPLE (INCLUDING TWELVE AUDITORS SPECIALIZED 
              IN CONDUCTING SUPPLIER AUDITS AND MONITORING ANOMALIES); DEPENDING ON NEEDS (LOCATIONS, WORKLOAD, ETC.). THIS TEAM CAN BE 
              ASSISTED BY AN EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDER;</li>
            <li>3. UNIFORM PROCEDURES: THERE ARE CLEAR AND UNIFORM PROCEDURES FOR ALL THE HOUSES, CORRESPONDING TO THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE 
              SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIP, INCLUDING THE ACTIVATION PROCEDURE, MONITORING PROCEDURE, TERMINATION OF CONTRACT PROCEDURE;</li>
            <li>4. RISK-BASED AUDITING: A RISK EVALUATION USED, ON THE BASIS OF COLLECTIVE DATA TO CLASSIFY SUPPLIERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THREE LEVELS 
              OF RISK (HIGH, MEDIUM OR LOW) AND TO CONSTRUCT AN AUDIT PLAN. AUDIT PLANS ARE UPDATED MONTHLY BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE VARIOUS 
              HOUSES AND/OR THE OCCURRENCE OF PARTICULAR EVENTS;</li>
            <li>5. STANDARDISED AUDITS: A SINGLE AND COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT METHODOLOGY WITH A QUESTIONNAIRE CONTAINING 88 QUESTIONS DIVIDED INTO 
              13 CATEGORIES AMONG WHICH CHILD LABOUR &amp; FORCED LABOUR AND ALIGNED WITH THE BEST STANDARDS IN THE FIELD, IN PARTICULAR THE SA8000 
              AND SMETA STANDARDS. FOLLOW-UP AUDITS INCLUDE A SMALLER SCOPE FOCUS ON THE AREA(S) IN WHICH BREACHES OF COMPLIANCE WERE 
              IDENTIFIED OR OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE DURING THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT. IN ANY CASE, THE ANNOUNCED OR UNANNOUNCED AUDITS 
              CONSIST OF DOCUMENT REVIEWS, SITE TOURS, AND WORKERS INTERVIEWS. WORKERS ARE SELECTED TO OFFER A REPRESENTATION OF THE 
              WORKFORCE, NOTABLY CONCERNING AGE AND UNION AFFILIATION, IF ANY. THESE INTERVIEWS ARE CONFIDENTIAL. THE FREQUENCY OF AUDITS 
              DEPENDS ON THE FINDINGS OF PREVIOUS AUDITS. NEVERTHELESS, PERIODIC AUDITS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN REGULARLY TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.</li>
            <li>6. TAKING ACTION: SUPPLIER NON-COMPLIANCES ARE CLASSIFIED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES, WITH STANDARD RESPONSE FOR EACH :
              <ol>
                <li>6-1. BREACHES BY SUPPLIERS’ SUBJECT TO ZERO TOLERANCE (RELATING TO THE MOST SERIOUS SITUATIONS LIABLE TO BE ENCOUNTERED, AMONG 
                    WHICH CHILD LABOUR AND FORCED LABOUR). IDENTIFICATION OF A ZERO-TOLERANCE BREACH TRIGGERS THE IMMEDIATE ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
                    CRISIS UNIT BRINGING TOGETHER THE KERING AUDIT TEAM AND THE RELEVANT HOUSE(S) TO DECIDE ON THE FUTURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
                    SUPPLIER: IMMEDIATE SHUTDOWN OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS IF THE SUPPLIER IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING ACTIVATED BUT HAS NOT STARTED 
                    WORKING; AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF REMEDIATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE SUPPLIER OR ABOUT THE NEED TO TERMINATE THE 
                    CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP IF THE SUPPLIER IS WORKING ON ONE OR MORE ORDERS. THE BRAND IS THE ULTIMATE DECISION-MAKER ON THE MOST 
                    APPROPRIATE RESPONSE,</li>
                <li>6-2. SERIOUS COMPLIANCE BREACHES BY SUPPLIERS. THE SUPPLIER IS GIVEN ONE MONTH TO RESOLVE THE SERIOUS BREACH OF COMPLIANCE, AND A 
                    FOLLOW-UP AUDIT IS SCHEDULED TO CONFIRM THAT THE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED,</li>
                <li>6-3. MODERATE COMPLIANCE BREACHES BY SUPPLIERS. THE SUPPLIER IS GIVEN THREE MONTHS TO RESOLVE THE MODERATE BREACH OF COMPLIANCE, 
                    AND A FOLLOW-UP AUDIT IS SCHEDULED TO CONFIRM THAT THE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED,</li>
                <li>6-4. OBSERVATIONS. THESE GIVE RISE TO A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN AND ARE THE SUBJECT OF A DEDICATED CHECKLIST AT THE NEXT AUDIT. THE 
                    SUPPLIER HAS SIX MONTHS TO REMEDY THE OBSERVATION.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>FOR EACH OF THE 13 CATEGORIES OF THE COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT REQUIREMENTS, A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES ZERO-
            TOLERANCE BREACHES, SERIOUS BREACHES OF COMPLIANCE, MODERATE BREACHES OF COMPLIANCE AND OBSERVATIONS HAS BEEN PREPARED. 
            DEPENDING ON THE RESULTS OF AUDITS, SUPPLIERS ARE CLASSIFIED AS: COMPLIANT; PARTIALLY; PROGRESS EXPECTED; ZERO TOLERANCE.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>C - COMPLEMENTARY TOOLS AND ACTIONS</b>
            <p>TO COMPLEMENT THE CORE HERCULES RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, VARIOUS TOOLS AND ACTIONS ARE DEPLOYED.</p>
            <strong>TRAINING</strong>
            <p>ALL GROUP EMPLOYEES TAKE A COMPULSORY ANNUAL ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE COURSE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES SET OUT IN THE KERING’S CODE 
              OF ETHICS.</p>
            <p>IN 2019, KERING’S TEAMS CONTINUED THEIR WORK ON THE CIRCULATION OF THE KERING STANDARDS. EACH HOUSE HELD ONE OR MORE SESSIONS 
              INTERNALLY. THE KERING STANDARDS HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH ALL OF THE GROUP’S KEY SUPPLIERS. A NUMBER OF EXPLANATORY AND TRAINING 
              SESSIONS WERE ALSO HELD IN 2019, AS IN 2018, PARTICULARLY FOR SUPPLIERS OF THE LEATHER GOODS, FASHION AND WATCHES ACTIVITIES.</p>
            <p>TO ROUND OUT THESE TRAINING COURSES, KERING’S SUSTAINABILITY DEPARTMENT PUT IN PLACE AN INTERNAL E- LEARNING PROGRAM PRESENTING 
              ALL OF THE KERING STANDARDS. THE COURSE HAS BEEN COMPLETED BY MORE THAN 4,400 GROUP EMPLOYEES TO DATE. KERING ALSO WORKED TO 
              ADAPT IT TO EXTERNAL AUDIENCES IN 2019, WITH A VIEW TO CIRCULATING IT MORE WIDELY AMONG SUPPLIERS. A PILOT COURSE WAS ORGANIZED 
              WITH AROUND TEN LEATHER SUPPLIERS IN JULY 2019, WITH A VIEW TO MUCH BROADER CIRCULATION LATER. THESE TRAINING SUPPORT CONTAIN 
              ELEMENTS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS.</p>
            <strong>WHISTLEBLOWING SYSTEM</strong>
            <p>INTRODUCED IN 2005, KERING’S WHISTLEBLOWING SYSTEM WAS STRENGTHENED IN 2018 TO ENSURE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH FRANCE’S SAPIN II LAW. 
              IT IS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL PEOPLE WORKING FOR THE GROUP AND EXTERNAL AND TEMPORARY PERSONNEL WORKING FOR EXTERNAL PARTNERS OR 
              SERVICE PROVIDERS UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE GROUP AND/OR ITS HOUSES. ALL EMPLOYEES AND DIRECT SUPPLIERS MAY USE THE SYSTEM TO 
              SUBMIT REPORTS. IT MAY BE USED TO REPORT ANY SUSPICION RELATED TO MODERN SLAVERY - AMONG OTHER OFFENSES OR VIOLATIONS. KERING IS 
              COMMITTED TO PROTECTING WHISTLEBLOWERS WHO RAISED AN ISSUE IN GOOD FAITH, AND EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS ANY FORM OF REPRISAL IN ITS 
              ETHICS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>D- WORKING TOGETHER</b>
            <p>AS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE LUXURY GOODS INDUSTRY AND AWARE OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN RESPECT OF A WIDE RANGE OF SUPPLIERS, 
              SUBCONTRACTORS AND RAW MATERIAL PRODUCTION CHAINS, KERING ENGAGES IN CONTINUOUS AND COLLABORATIVE DIALOGUE ON HUMAN 
              RIGHTS AND MODERN SLAVERY WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN ITS SUPPLY CHAINS AND BEYOND. KERING IS A MEMBER OF THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES, 
              GROUPS AND PROGRAMMES:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>1. THE SUSTAINABLE APPAREL COALITION - WHICH WORKS TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS CAUSED BY THE 
                INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE;</li>
              <li>2. TEXTILE EXCHANGE EUROPE - WHICH WORKS TO DRIVE SUSTAINABLE TRANSFORMATION IN THE INDUSTRY. KERING IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN A 
                NUMBER OF ITS SUB-GROUPS, INCLUDING THE RESPONSIBLE CASHMERE ROUNDTABLE, RESPONSIBLE LEATHER ROUNDTABLE, RESPONSIBLE WOOL 
                STANDARD, ORGANIC COTTON ROUNDTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE DOWN STANDARD;</li>
              <li>3. BUSINESS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (BSR), ESPECIALLY ITS GLOBAL BUSINESS COALITION AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING (GBCAT), FORMED BY 
                MAJOR PRIVATE GROUPS AND NGOS TO COMBAT MODERN SLAVERY, PRIMARILY BY DETECTING AND ERADICATING IT FROM COMPANIES’ COMPLEX 
                SUPPLY CHAINS;</li>
              <li>4. THE MEKONG CLUB, WHICH TACKLES PROBLEMS OF MODERN SLAVERY ;</li>

          </li>
        </ol>
        <strong>4 - OUTCOMES AND KPIS</strong>
        <p>WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO OF SUPPLIERS PRESENTED IN SECTION 3.B, 3,441 AUDITS WERE CONDUCTED IN 2019 (AN INCREASE OF 20% COMPARED WITH 
          2018), BREAKING DOWN AS 1,840 COMPREHENSIVE AUDITS AND 1,601 FOLLOW -UP AUDITS. A TOTAL OF 39.3% OF THESE AUDITS WERE CARRIED OUT BY 
          KERING’S SUPPLY CHAIN AUDIT TEAM, AND 60.7% BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS, WITH THE GROUP AUDIT PROTOCOL APPLIED IN THE SAME WAY FOR ALL 
          AUDITS CONDUCTED. THIS MEANS THAT 56% OF SUPPLIERS WERE AUDITED IN 2019. OVER THE 2015 - 2019 PERIOD, 83% OF SUPPLIERS WERE AUDITED. 
          MOREOVER, KERING HAS UNDERTAKEN TO AUDIT ALL OF ITS KEY SUPPLIERS EVERY TWO YEARS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT “ACTIVATION” AUDITS FOR 
          NEW SUPPLIERS ARE COMPREHENSIVE AUDITS, AND THAT THEY THEREFORE COVER THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT.</p>
        <p>FOLLOWING THESE AUDITS, 58.9% OF SUPPLIERS WERE RATED COMPLIANT, 30.1% PARTIALLY COMPLIANT, 10.3% PROGRESS EXPECTED AND 0.7% ZERO 
          TOLERANCE. A TOTAL OF 68 SUPPLIERS SAW THEIR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP TERMINATED IN 2019 DUE TO UNSATISFACTORY AUDIT RESULTS. ROBUST 
          CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS WERE PUT TOGETHER FOLLOWING THE AUDITS, WHEREVER BREACHES OF COMPLIANCE, AND PARTICULARLY SERIOUS 
          BREACHES, WERE IDENTIFIED. FOLLOW-UP AUDITS WERE THEN CONDUCTED TO VERIFY THE RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. THE ZERO-TOLERANCE 
          BREACHES IDENTIFIED DURING THE AUDITS WERE DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ESTABLISHED RULES AND IN COORDINATION WITH 
          THE RELEVANT HOUSES. TO SPEED UP THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES, THE CENTRAL TEAM HELD MORE THAN 220 COMMITTEE MEETINGS WITH THE 
          HOUSES IN 2019, WHICH EFFECTIVELY RESULTED IN THE RESOLUTION OF A LARGE NUMBER OF ANOMALIES.</p>
