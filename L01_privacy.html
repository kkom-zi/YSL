                  HARASSMENT, INSULTS OR DIRECT THREATS FROM USERS WILL BE REPORTED TO OUR DEDICATED TEAM. THIS WILL GENERATE A WARNING 
                  TO THE CONCERNED USER, AND THEY WILL BE RECORDED ON OUR PROVISIONAL LIST. THE INITIAL WARNING WILL SET OUT THE 
                  CONSEQUENCES OF A SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRING. A SECOND INCIDENT WILL LEAD TO THE SUSPENSION OF ANY FURTHER CALLS 
                  FROM THE USER IN QUESTION FOR A PERIOD OF 4 MONTHS. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE USER WILL STILL BE ABLE TO CONTACT OUR

            <b>10. FOR HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b>
            <p>OUR GENERAL APPROACH IS TO RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLY FOR AS LONG AS IT IS NEEDED.</p>
            <p>WHEN YOU HAVE A SAINT LAURENT PROFILE, A TEMPORARY RECORD OR SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTERS, WE GENERALLY RETAIN YOUR 
              PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR 5 YEARS FROM THE LAST INTERACTION YOU INITIATED WITH US.</p>
            <p>WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH OUR CUSTOMER SERVICES, WE GENERALLY RETAIN THE RECORDINGS OF THE CALLS FOR 40 DAYS (UNLESS A 
              LONGER RETENTION PERIOD IS PERMITTED BY LAW), AND THE OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU HAVE SHARED WITH US (INCLUDING 
              PERSONAL INFORMATION SHARED BY MAIL, CHAT OR TEXT MESSAGE OR WHEN OUR INTERACTION IS TRANSCRIBED) FOR 5 YEARS FROM THE 
              LAST INTERACTION YOU INITIATED WITH US.</p>
            <p>WE MAY RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR A SHORTER OR LONGER TIME, FOR INSTANCE, WHERE WE ARE OBLIGED TO DO SO IN 
              ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT LEGAL, TAX AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS.</p>
            <p>LAST INTERACTION SHALL BE DEFINED AS THE LAST CONTACT YOU INITIATED WHICH IS TRACEABLE BY OUR SYSTEMS OR BY A SALES 
              ASSOCIATE. LAST CONTACT COULD BE THE LAST TIME A CALL, SALES EMAIL, OR MEETING WAS PROPOSED TO YOU AND TO WHICH YOU 
              RESPONDED FAVORABLY. FOR INSTANCE, CLICKING ON A LINK INCLUDED IN AN EMAIL (EXCEPT FOR A LINK TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM 
              RECEIVING MARKETING CONTENT), HAVING A CHAT ON OUR WEBSITE OR ATTENDING AN APPOINTMENT IN ONE OF OUR STORES ARE 
              CONSIDERED A LAST CONTACT. CONVERSELY, OPENING AN EMAIL OR VISITING OUR WEBSITE WITHOUT LOGGING IN WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS 
              LAST CONTACT.</p>
            <p>BEFORE DELETING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM YOUR SAINT LAURENT OR TEMPORARY RECORD, WE WILL CONTACT YOU TO 
              INFORM YOU OF SUCH DELETION AND YOU MAY ASK US TO KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. BY NOT ANSWERING YOU AGREE TO THE 
              DELETION OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE ARE NOT LEGALLY OBLIGED TO KEEP FOR LONGER IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGAL, TAX 
              AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS.</p>
            <p>WE WILL DELETE OR DESTROY YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT DELAY ONCE IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY (E.G., IF THE PURPOSES 
              OF COLLECTION/USE OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED, IF THE STATUTORY RETENTION PERIOD EXPIRES) IN A 
              WAY THAT PREVENTS SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM BEING RESTORED OR RECOVERED. IF PRINTED ON PAPER, THE PERSONAL 
              INFORMATION WILL BE DESTROYED BY SHREDDING, INCINERATING, OR SOME OTHER SIMILAR METHOD AND, IF SAVED IN ELECTRONIC FORM, 
              THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL BE DESTROYED BY TECHNICAL METHODS WHICH ENSURE THAT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION CANNOT 
              BE RESTORED OR RECOVERED THEREAFTER.</p>
            <p>IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY ALSO RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR LONGER ACCORDING TO THE APPLICABLE STATUTE 
              OF LIMITATIONS SO THAT WE HAVE AN ACCURATE RECORD OF YOUR DEALINGS WITH US IN THE EVENT OF ANY COMPLAINTS OR 
              CHALLENGES.</p>
            <p>IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN INFORMATION WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE IMPORTANT FOR SAINT LAURENT HISTORY OR PATRIMONY 
              MAY BE RETAINED BY US FOR LONGER PERIODS EXCLUSIVELY FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES, FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES OR FOR STATISTICAL 
              PURPOSES. THIS MAY BE THE CASE WHEN SOME OF OUR NOTABLE CUSTOMERS HAVE BENEFITED FROM OUR SERVICES OR BOUGHT OUR

            <p>WE, SAINT LAURENT, ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SAFE.</p>
            <p>TO DO SO, WE DESIGN OUR SERVICES WITH YOUR SAFETY IN MIND. WITHIN OUR GROUP, WE HAVE DEDICATED TEAMS MANAGING AND 
              ENSURING THE SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE HAVE ADOPTED SPECIFIC TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL 
              SECURITY MEASURES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION AGAINST 
              ACCIDENTAL OR UNLAWFUL DESTRUCTION, ACCIDENTAL LOSS, ALTERATION, UNAUTHORISED DISCLOSURE OR ACCESS.</p>
            <p>FOR EXAMPLE, WHENEVER PERSONAL INFORMATION IS PASSED BETWEEN YOUR DEVICE AND OUR SERVERS, WE ENSURE THAT IT IS 
              ENCRYPTED USING SECURE SOCKETS LAYER ("SSL") AND/OR OTHER SECURITY METHODS. WE IMPLEMENT HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL 
              OVER SECURE SOCKET LAYER ("HTTPS") IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR CONNECTION TO OUR WEBSITE. ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS 
              STORED ON SECURED SERVERS.</p>
            <p>WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED A SPECIALISED PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, WE STRICTLY 
              CONTROL THE SCOPE OF AUTHORISATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT 
              AND PROCESS. WE THUS DISCLOSE OR PROVIDE ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLY ON A STRICT NEED TO KNOW BASIS TO 
              OUR EMPLOYEES OR TO THE THIRD PARTIES LISTED IN THE SECTION WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?, AND ONLY 
              THROUGH SECURED SYSTEMS. WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION, STORAGE AND PROCESSING PRACTICES, INCLUDING 
              PHYSICAL SECURITY MEASURES, TO GUARD AGAINST ANY UNAUTHORISED ACCESS AND USE.</p>
            <p>WE CONDUCT SECURITY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION TRAINING COURSES AND TESTS ON A REGULAR BASIS TO ENHANCE OUR EMPLOYEES' 
              AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE TAKE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE STEPS TO MAKE SURE 
              THAT OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. OUR 
              EMPLOYEES AND THOSE OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL 
              INFORMATION ARE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL PRIVACY 
              PROVISIONS.</p>
            <p>IN THE EVENT OF A SECURITY INCIDENT RESULTING IN ANY BREACH OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AS QUALIFIED BY LAW, WE HAVE AN 
              EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IN PLACE TO PREVENT THE EXPANSION OF SUCH SECURITY INCIDENTS. IN ADDITION, WE WILL REPORT SUCH 
              PERSONAL INFORMATION BREACH TO THE RELEVANT SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND INFORM YOU VIA AN 
              APPROPRIATE CHANNEL AS AND WHERE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
            <p>PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT IN ORDER TO KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE, WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME, HAVE TO RESET YOUR

            <p>HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT NO SERVICE CAN BE COMPLETELY SECURE, AND YOU PLAY A KEY ROLE IN KEEPING YOUR

              SHOULD TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES FOR THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TRANSMISSION OVER THE NETWORK (E.G. WITH 
              FIREWALLS AND ANTI-SPAM FILTERING). YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF INTERACTING OVER THE INTERNET AND WILL 
              NOT HOLD US OR OUR PARTNERS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SECURITY INCIDENT OR BREACH OF PERSONAL INFORMATION UNLESS IT IS DUE TO

                  LISTENING IN REAL TIME, WITH PRIOR NOTICE TO YOU); ALSO, MINDFUL OF THE HEALTH OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AND FOR THIS SOLE PURPOSE, 
                  WE IMPLEMENT AN ANTI-MALICIOUS CALLS PROCEDURE SO THAT ANY OCCURRENCE OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS SUCH AS HARASSMENT, 
                  INSULTS OR DIRECT THREATS FROM USERS WILL BE REPORTED TO OUR DEDICATED TEAM. THIS WILL GENERATE A WARNING TO THE 
                  CONCERNED USER AND THEY WILL BE RECORDED ON OUR PROVISIONAL LIST. THE INITIAL WARNING WILL SET OUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
                  A SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRING. A SECOND INCIDENT WILL LEAD TO THE SUSPENSION OF ANY FURTHER CALLS FROM THE USER IN 
                  QUESTION FOR A PERIOD OF 4 MONTHS. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE USER WILL STILL BE ABLE TO CONTACT OUR CUSTOMER SERVICES BY 
                  OTHER COMMUNICATION CHANNELS (E.G., REGULAR MAIL OR EMAIL) SO WE CAN ATTEND THEIR QUERIES AND PRESERVE THEIR RIGHTS AT
